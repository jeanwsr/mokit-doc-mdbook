# 5.6 Generating different GVB solutions
This section is for experienced GVB users. For conjugated molecules, there often
exists multiple GVB solutions.

## 5.6.1 \\( \sigma \\) - \\( \pi \\) separated *v.s.* \\( \sigma \\) - \\( \pi \\) mixed solution
To be added.

## 5.6.2 closed-shell-like *v.s.* diradical-like solution
To be added.
