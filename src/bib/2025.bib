  abstract = {High-level calculations demonstrate the mechanism of the Cu-catalyzed dimerization of norbornenes and cyclohexenes, providing insights for developing olefin dimerization photocatalysts.           ,                             The Cu(               i               )-photocatalyzed cycloaddition reaction has become an important way to construct four-membered ring products. A recent experiment reported the photocycloaddition of norbornenes (nb) and cyclohexenes (ch) catalyzed by CuOTf. However, the atomic level details remain lacking. Herein, using high-level electronic structure methods, the initial photophysics and subsequent dimerization reaction of two Cu complexes ([Cu(nb)               2               ]               +               and [Cu(ch)               2               ]               +               ) were explored. For both species, the               1               MLCT state is initially populated and there are two triplet states (               3               MLCT and               3               LC). Notably, in [Cu(ch)               2               ]               +               , an additional               1               LC state appears near               1               MLCT rendering               1               MLCT short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally as a result of an ultrafast internal conversion to               1               LC. Through direct and               3               MLCT-mediated intersystem crossing, the lowest               3               LC state is populated. The most striking difference of the               3               LC structures of [Cu(ch)               2               ]               +               and [Cu(nb)               2               ]               +               is that one cyclohexene of the former undergoes a half-chair-to-chair conformational change while the latter does not. From the precursor               3               LC, two successive but nonadiabatic reactions form two C--C bonds in the               3               LC and S               0               states, respectively. The current work provides the first efforts to understand the atomistic details of the Cu-catalyzed dimerization of norbornenes and cyclohexenes and paves a way for rationally designing superior photocatalysts for olefins dimerization.},

Notably, the WnF               4               O system exhibits greater stability than its WnF               2               O counterpart, with the exception of the CrF               x               O system. The charge transfer between the interacting molecules lies between 0.0114 and 0.0946e in magnitude.

  abstract = {As a crucial parameter in M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy, nuclear quadrupole splitting (NQS) exhibits a strong dependence on quantum chemistry methods, which makes accurate theoretical predictions challenging. Meanwhile, the continuous emergence of new density functionals presents opportunities to advance current NQS research. In this study, we evaluate the performance of eleven hybrid density functionals and twelve double-hybrid density functionals, selected from widely used functionals and newly developed functionals, in predicting the NQS values of the 57Fe nuclide for 32 iron-containing molecules within about 70 atoms. The calculations have incorporated scalar relativistic effects using the exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian. In general, the double-hybrid functional PBE-0DH demonstrates superior performance compared to the experimental values, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.20 mm/s. Meanwhile, rSCAN38 is the best hybrid functional for our database with an MAE = 0.25 mm/s, and it offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency over PBE-0DH. The +/- sign of NQS has also been considered in our error statistics when it has a clear physical meaning; if neglected, the errors of many functionals decrease, but PBE-0DH and rSCAN38 remain unaffected. Notably, when calculating ferrocene [Fe(C5H5)2], which involves strong static correlations, all hybrid functionals that incorporate more than 10\% exact exchange fail, while several double-hybrid functionals continue to deliver reliable results. In addition, we encountered two particularly challenging species characterized by strong static correlations: [Fe(H2O)5NO]2+ and FeO2--porphyrin. Unfortunately, none of the density functionals tested in our study yielded satisfactory results for the two cases since the density functional theory (DFT) is a single-determinant approach, and it is imperative to explore large-scale multi-configurational methods for these species. This research offers valuable guidance for selecting density functionals in M{\"o}ssbauer NQS calculations and serves as a reference point for the future development of new density functionals.},
